# MonoAsteroids game

This app is an analogue of the well-known game in which, while flying on a starship, you need to shoot asteroids and
dodge UFOs. Btw, original title is still trademarked. Therefore, this app has an absolutely unique, completely different
name :)

The development of this game was started as part of a test task a few days ago. As usual, I distribute its code under
the Apache License 2.0. Feel free to use it for any purpose.
